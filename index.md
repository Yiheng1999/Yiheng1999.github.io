### Projects  

- **Java**  
Implement Maximum network flow of a graph by using Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm. Can be applied in calculating cars pass in highway. The weight of edge can be seen as cars passes this part of road in the highway, and the weight of vertex can be seen as the maximum amount of cars allowed passes in each entrance;  

- **C**  
Implement filter pattern into BMP images, add filter into the image. Can be applied in avatar design. Users can change their avatars in designate patterns as they like.  

- **OCaml**  
Using OCaml type checking to judge when to use brackets in calculation. For example, ignoring the calculation sequence, 5+3x5=(5+3)x5=40. With respect to calculation sequence, 5+(3x5)=20. The decision tree and expression tree has been used to analysis the calculation and convert it to MIPS-ish pseudcode.
